Hey there!

I'm **Daniel**, a frontend developer based in Tema, Ghana. I design and build web experiences that feel smooth and work beautifully.

I'm currently working on **Swapskill** and shipping projects built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and modern web technologies. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll code it and deploy it.

My main tech stack is **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and I'm always learning new tools like TanStack Router and GraphQL to level up my skills.

I've built a bunch of projects, and I'm passionate about clean code, good design, and creating interfaces that users actually enjoy using.

Fun Facts:
* I believe JavaScript is both chaotic and beautiful
* When I'm not coding, I'm either watching stand-up comedy or football
